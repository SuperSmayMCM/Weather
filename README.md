# The Madison Children's Museum Welcome Wall Weather Widget

This is a very simple HTML/CSS/JS widget designed to be used with BrightSign. It fetches data from the National Weather Service to display. The NWS API is free for us to use, and certainly the easiest option available. It doesn't even require an account or API key.

The initial HTML body and initial JavaScript was generated by Gemini, but was later modified to fit our needs. 

Because it was designed to be used with BrightSign, it doesn't have a border or background, as the HTML widget background is transparent by default, which is ideal for what we needed. 

The lat/long for MCM has been hardcoded, as that was the simplest way to do it and it's not like that value is going to change anytime soon :). Similarly, the font sizes and colors have been hardcoded to match what the slide the weather was going on used. The font is the same one we used on the slides, Avenir Next. I pulled it from the macOS font book, which might technically break some TOS somewhere but we have it uploaded Canva anyway so I presume we have a license for it. The weather icons are from an open source project, found [here](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons). 

The code is commented and should be maintainable by anyone who knows Javascript. The documentation for how to upload the widget to the BrightSign players is on the Public SharePoint.

Enjoy!
